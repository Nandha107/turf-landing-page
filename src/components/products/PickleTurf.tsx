            The court should adhere to standard dimensions, which are 18 meters
            (59 feet) in length and 9 meters (29.5 feet) in width. The playing
            area should include an additional free zone of at least 3 meters
            (9.8 feet) on all sides, allowing players ample space to move during
            play. The net, which should be 2.43 meters (7 feet 11 5/8 inches)
            high for men's play and 2.24 meters (7 feet 4 1/8 inches) for
            women's play, must be securely anchored and positioned centrally.
